# HandyNotes: Secret Fish

This walks you through the hidden fish for [Secret Fish of Mechagon](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=13489/secret-fish-of-mechagon) and [Secret Fish and Where to Find Them](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=13502/secret-fish-and-where-to-find-them).

Initially you'll see icons only in Mechagon, showing valid locations to fish up the quest fish there. Give them all to Danielle Anglers and you'll earn the [Secret Fish Goggles](https://www.wowhead.com/item=167698/secret-fish-goggles).

Now icons will appear all over the world. Just look at the map of Azeroth and follow the fishing hooks. There'll only be icons on specific zone maps if there are precise locations you need to collect the secret fish in. Make sure to use your goggles.

There are other fish which will be found anywhere in the world, and two which are day/night specific. These have no icons.

Note that this **requires** [HandyNotes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes), so go install it as well.
